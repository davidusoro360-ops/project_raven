# Fingerprinting Audit Report
- Date: 2025-08-27
- Repository: rayven

## Scope
- Full scan of first-party source [src](src), entry [index.html](index.html), build config [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts), and package manifest [package.json](package.json).

## Methodology
- Searched for common browser fingerprinting indicators across first-party code using pattern groups covering:
  - Canvas 2D and data URL extraction
  - WebGL renderer/vendor and extension queries
  - Web Audio API spectral data collection
  - WebRTC connection and device enumeration
  - Navigator hardware, memory, plugins, mimeTypes, battery, permissions, userAgentData
  - Intl timezone and Screen properties
- Also scanned for known third-party fingerprinting libraries by name.

## Findings summary
- First-party application code
  - No fingerprinting indicators were found in [src](src) or [index.html](index.html).
- Third-party packages (benign references)
  - Icon pack contains a decorative Fingerprint SVG icon:
    - [node_modules/.vite/deps/lucide-react.js](node_modules/.vite/deps/lucide-react.js:6388)
  - TypeScript DOM ambient type definitions reference many web APIs often used by fingerprinting; these are type declarations only, not executable code:
    - [node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts](node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts:13416)
  - Vite internal SVG handling converts SVG content to a data URL during bundling; this is asset processing, not runtime canvas fingerprinting:
    - [node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-C6uTJdX2.js](node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-C6uTJdX2.js:20436)

## Risk classification
- First-party code: No browser fingerprinting behavior detected.
- Third-party code: No evidence of fingerprinting behavior; references are either icons, type declarations, or build-time utilities.

## Evidence detail
- Zero matches for fingerprinting patterns in first-party paths:
  - [src](src)
  - [index.html](index.html)
  - [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts)

## Recommendations
- Keep a dependency allowlist and review any future additions that include fingerprinting utilities.
- Add a CI check that searches for known indicators across application code before merges.
- Consider a Content Security Policy that limits access to sensors and disallows use of powerful features unless needed.
- Perform runtime auditing in QA with browser devtools to ensure no unexpected access to sensitive APIs in production builds.

## Verification steps to reproduce
- Re-run a repository-wide search focused on first-party directories for the same indicator categories listed above.
- Inspect any future matches for intent and usage context before release.

## Conclusion
- At the time of this audit, no browser fingerprinting techniques are present in the applicationâ€™s first-party code. The few occurrences in dependencies are non-executable definitions or purely decorative assets.
